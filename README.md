_**Author's Note (2020.9.16) ↝** The Arcane MMORPG project is currently on hold in order to make time for other endeavors. It currently has basic connection and syncronization functionality. Players can move around, chat with each other, and perform basic actions. System communication leverages a [JSON-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC)-esque messaging protocol between the client and the server._

A client for the retro-style MMORPG Arcane created with GameMaker. See also the
[arcane-server repo](https://github.com/lukehollenback/arcane-server).
